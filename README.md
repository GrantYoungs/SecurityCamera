# SecurityCamera
Python code to turn a webcam into a security camera, using OpenCV for Python.
Perfect for a security camera Raspberry Pi project!

This script uses OpenCV for Python, so that must be installed in order for this to run:
  python -m pip install opencv-python
  
Additionally, by default the code saves videos to the folder "videos". That folder must be created before the videos can be saved. If you wish to change the default
save directoy, you can configure that in the python file.
